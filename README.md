### FlexBox Module

HTML5 Elements and CSS3 Flexible Box Layout

This customizable fluid layout targets any screen size, adapting to mobile resolutions including iPhone and iPad

Sidebars flex depending on screen size in relation to center content (can be set to fixed width if desired)

Source order is also flexible (customizable order currently set to: main, left, right)

Javascript is required for scrolling capabilities within the layout areas combined with a sticky footer (not iPhone/iPad)

Issues: no IE or Opera compatibility (IE plans to implement flex box in IE10, Opera has no planned support yet)
